# Onegin
This industrial-style program allows to **sort texts** from the beginning and from the end using **lexicographic principles**.

## Usage
Run program with `./path/to/file/onegin <FILENAME>` or wilh `./path/to/file/onegin` to use default name for input file (*input_text.txt*). The file is the file with text you want to work with. The program will generate sorted from the beginning and from the end text in three different blocks (the third block consists of original text).
